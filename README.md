# Python Selenium & Web Automation Projects

Welcome to my Selenium Web Automation repository. This collection of projects demonstrates my ability to control web browsers, interact with dynamic DOM elements, and automate complex web workflows using Python.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into specific modules, ranging from fundamental DOM interactions to handling complex, dynamically loaded Single-Page Applications (SPAs).

### 1. Web Automation Basics & E-Commerce (`/selenyum`)
This module focuses on the core principles of web scraping and browser control.
* **Key Concepts:** DOM navigation, element targeting (XPath, CSS Selectors, IDs), explicit waits (`WebDriverWait`), and basic data extraction.
* **Highlight:** Includes an Object-Oriented script (`slenyum_Alıs_Veris.py`) that fully automates a shopping workflow on a demo e-commerce site—from logging in and finding the most expensive item to completing the checkout process.

### 2. Advanced Dynamic Bots (`/selenyum_bot`)
This module tackles the challenges of modern, dynamic web pages (specifically Instagram).
* **Key Concepts:** Handling pop-ups, bypassing cookie consents, and managing infinite scrolling mechanisms.
* **Highlight:** The advanced bot (`instagram_bot2.py`) injects custom JavaScript into the browser to manipulate scroll heights and dynamically scrape followers, utilizing Python sets to ensure data uniqueness.

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Library:** Selenium WebDriver
* **Automation Patterns:** * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for scalable bot design.
  * Utilizing `chromedriver_autoinstaller` for seamless environment setup.
  * Implementing robust error handling (`try-except`) and Explicit Waits to prevent flakiness in automated scripts.

## Getting Started

To run these projects locally on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/kadir465/Selenium-Bot-Projects.git](https://github.com/kadir465/Selenium-Bot-Projects.git)

2.Install the required dependencies:
pip install selenium chromedriver-autoinstaller

3.Navigate to the specific project directory you want to test and follow the instructions in its local README.md file regarding setup (e.g., adding credential files).
